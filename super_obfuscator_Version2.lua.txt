--[[
Super Strong Lua Obfuscator Template

Insert your advanced obfuscation logic here.
Some techniques to implement:
- Identifier renaming
- String encryption
- Control flow flattening
- Junk code insertion
- Dynamic code generation
- Remove formatting
- Self-modifying code
- Anti-tamper/anti-debugging

Below is a basic passthrough, replace with your own implementation.

local input_file = arg[1]
local f = io.open(input_file, "r")
local code = f:read("*a")
f:close()

-- Add watermark at the top
local watermark = "-- This file has been obfuscated by Passive V1\n"

-- TODO: Replace with your real obfuscation logic!
local obfuscated = watermark .. "-- [OBFUSCATED]\n" .. code

print(obfuscated)
